    My project idea is to code a program that will allow you to monitor your entire computer<br>
    system’s temperatures and performance output as well as tweak your hardware’s performance,<br>
    from fan and pump speeds to calculating safe and maximum overclocking limits for your RAM<br>
    (Random Access Memory) or directly overclocking your GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), and<br>
    CPU (Central Processing Unit) from within the program. Not only will you be able to control<br>
    everything from one location with a pleasing customizable user interface, but you will also<br>
    be able to customize all RGB lighting features your computer and all peripherals have, without<br>
    the requirement of various program installations (e.g. Asus AURA, MSI Mystic Light, iCUE).<br>
    <br>

	The pre-existing programs in place used to control things such as overclocking or RGB features<br>
    in your computer are often clunky, unresponsive, and sometimes aren't updated for long periods.<br>
    By creating a program such as this, I will eliminate the need to have multiple programs unnecessarily<br>
    taking up resources on your computer. In 2018 an estimated 1.2 billion people were gaming on<br>
    their computers (How Many Gamers Are There? 2018), with a large proportion of them having RGB<br>
    peripherals or hardware in their computers. Providing them with a program that can provide quality<br>
    of life improvements to their experience is bound to be loved by the community and by containing<br>
    not only overclocking capabilities but RGB synchronisation within the program, it is able to<br>
    appeal to both enthusiasts and gamers.<br>
	<br>
    
	My plan for the program is for it to consist of three main tabbed areas. The first area is the<br>
    observation zone, where after appropriate configuration (selecting which pieces of hardware<br>
    you want to monitor), you will be presented with a neat and tidy view of everything you want<br>
    to monitor on the one screen. This area will also be available from the click of a button on<br>
    your system tray or optionally shown on a second computer monitor. Included in this observation<br>
    zone will be a drop-down box containing various preset overclocking configurations chosen by<br>
    the user for easy access.<br>
								The second tab will be dedicated to overclocking, which is where<br>
    you will be able to directly adjust the temperature limits, clock speeds, and voltages of your<br>
    GPU and CPU, as well as the fan speeds and the pump speeds (if a compatible liquid cooling<br>
    system is installed) of the system. Within this area, you will also be able to calculate the<br>
    safe and fastest theoretical maximum overclock settings for your RAM by inputting the RAM type<br>
    and base clock speed, and then selecting which type of overclocking you want to perform. The<br>
    program will then calculate whichever option you have selected and present you with the ideal<br>
    settings to then input into your system's BIOS on startup. There will also be the option to<br>
    use preset configurations for your overclocking and to create your own, so that once you find<br>
    a configuration that you are happy with, you can save it for next time and switch between<br>
    different presets depending on what you need your computer to do.<br>
																	The third tab will be for<br>
    your system’s RGB features, allowing you to control all of the LED’s separately via a neat<br>
    interface. From here, you will be able to create groups of RGB enabled devices and control<br>
    them separately, or modify them all together as a group, giving you full creative freedom.<br>
    There will also be a preset section available with default lighting patterns and basic colours,<br>
    along with blank presets where you are encouraged to create your own designs and customise what<br>
    colours are being used through an RGB format form. The reason I want to use a simplified layout<br>
    for the GUI is because I want to keep the program streamlined and not bloated with unnecessary<br>
    graphical animations or features. The main point of the program is to eliminate the need for<br>
    multiple large resource-demanding programs while still doing its job effectively. Along with<br>
    this, I need the program to be able to run in the system tray behind the scenes so it is always<br>
    available for quick tweaks and easy access, without negatively impacting the performance of the PC.<br>
    <br>
    
    To be able to complete the project successfully, I will need to obtain various SDK’s (Software<br>
    Development Kits) according to which RGB products I want to support. Initially, there will be<br>
    support for the main RGB hardware creators (ASUS, MSI, Corsair, Razer, Gigabyte, and Thermaltake),<br>
    but after future updates, there will be full compatibility with the lesser-known brands that still<br>
    chose to use their own software instead of using a larger brands software for their RGB features.<br>
    I will also need a program to code Python in, such as PyCharm and a computer with RGB parts from<br>
    various companies to test the builds on.<br>
    <br>

	The skills I will need to have to complete the project will be an understanding of how hardware<br>
    systems work and interact with software, knowledge of how to code with Python, and how to use SDK<br>
    kits in conjunction with coding to create compatibility between pre-existing internal architecture<br>
    and the code I will be writing. I will get most of these skills during my studies at RMIT however<br>
    any that aren't taught can be self-taught using online reading materials, trial and error, and<br>
    practice. I believe that I will be able to gain all of the relevant skills to create a project like<br>
    this highly with only slight difficulty as long as I apply myself to my studies.<br>
    <br>

	If the project can be feasibly and successfully completed, it will provide beginners, computer<br>
    enthusiasts, and gamers alike with a platform where they can learn about the specifics of how their<br>
    PC is performing as well as giving them an easy method of overclocking using preset settings or their<br>
    own customised ones. They will also be provided with a powerful tool that allows them to control the<br>
    entirety of their PC’s hardware in one place, eliminating the need for numerous program installations<br>
    and providing a streamlined and speedy program that in turn will improve the quality of life of all<br>
    computer users.<br>
