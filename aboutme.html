    <a href="egg.html">Hello there!</a> As you may have read above, name is Declan! I’m currently 22 years old and I’m an avid student of the field of<br>
    Information Technology, currently completing my bachelors degree at RMIT via Open Universities <br>
    Australia. I was born in Australia and raised with an Italian background (as you may be able to tell<br>
    from the surname) so I have a great appreciation for good food that was instilled into me from my Nonno.<br>
	I'm a big fan of the NRL and the Melbourne Storm, so much so that I have an accreditation from the NRL<br>
	that allows me to go onto the field before and after the game! That's where the photo above was taken!<br>
    <br>
    Back in high school, I had a vast interest in chemistry and IT, even going on to become a Victorian <br>
    finalist in a chemistry competition held by RACI (Royal Australian Chemistry Institute). My keen<br>
    interest in IT first appeared during this time and it led to me dabbling in ametuer programming in<br> 
    the form of .bat file programs, trying to write up programs that create hidden lockable folders that<br>
    can only be revealed with the right code. Once I left school, I pursued a bachelor's degree in science,<br>
    hoping to major in chemistry. However, due to personal circumstances, I had to forfeit my position in<br>
    the course and take up work. During my spare time though I started to play around with website design,<br>
    learning how to host a website and do basic HTML/CSS coding. Eventually my interest in IT brought me to<br>
    the point where I needed a better computer, so I learnt how to build one! After saving up as much money<br>
    as I could, spending countless hours looking at parts and working out compatibilities, I built my first<br>
    PC and got straight into using VMware to emulate a MacOS environment to learn how to create iPhone apps.<br>
    However sadly I found myself too busy and not motivated enough to continue, so I stopped my IT experiments<br>
    and now after many years of not following up on what I had taught myself, most of it has slipped away...<br>
    but that is why I am eager to learn all of the skills I can in this field to prepare myself for a rewarding<br>
    career in the IT industry.<br>
    <br>
	I chose to study at RMIT due to the availability and accessibility of the course, the reviews that my<br>
    friends who have graduated from RMIT gave to me about the University itself, and because I know that what<br>
    I will be learning there will be deeply valued by the ICT industry and is consistently updating according<br>
    to what is favourable and required in the industry.<br>
	During my studies, I am expecting to learn all of the necessary skills required to begin a long and prosperous<br>
    career in the IT field, such as learning about the fundamentals of software engineering, understanding how<br>
    complex networking systems work, and learning about system security.<br>

	My Ideal Job

	</h1>
	<h2><div class='c'>
	<a href='http://www.ictcareer.com.au/jobs/7180-australian-federal-police/57604' target="_blank">Technical Analyst, Cyber Crimes - Australian Federal Police</a>
	<a href='styles/AFPJob.pdf' target="_blank">[Archive Copy]</a>
	</h2>
	
	<h3><div class='c'>
	Since I left high school, my ideal career has always been one in a policing capacity, because I always<br>
	wanted to help and protect people. A position like this at the AFP would allow me to use my technical<br>
	know-how and the skills I am going to learn and develop throughout my IT career to help protect our country<br>
	and its people. The job would entail working together with Senior Technical Specialists and Investigators<br>
	to help support Cyber Crime Operations teams with the technical skills and experience necessary to investigate<br>
	breaches of the law using cybertechnology.<br>
	<br>
	The skills I would require for the position would include proficiency in various coding languages, the<br>
	ability to deal with complex situations willingly and rapidly as they arise, a keen analytical eye, rapid<br>
	and effective problem-solving skills, strong leadership qualities, as well as the appropriate technical<br>
	knowledge of the IT field to understand the complex situations being investigated.<br>
	<br>
	The skills I have that would be required for the position are the fundamentals but not the technical knowledge<br>
	as of yet. They include having a very strong analytical aptitude, quick and effective problem-solving skills,<br>
	the foundational traits of a strong leader, and the ability to quickly adapt to situations and react appropriately.<br>
	<br>
	To gain the other required skills and further improve the ones that I do have, I will have to finish my studies<br>
	in the IT field and find myself a challenging position where I will be able to apply all of my skills and grow<br>
	further as a person, eventually resulting in a leadership role where I can learn to become a strong, reliable,<br>
	and effective leader. Practising my technical skills will be the only way to improve them to an appropriate<br>
	standard for the position. I also plan to seek out a mentor in the industry to help me learn and develop the<br>
	interpersonal skills required for such a position.<br></h3>
