	About Me
	</h1>
    
    <h4>
    <a href="styles/helloThere.webp">Hello there!</a> My name is Declan! I’m currently 22 years old and I’m an avid student of the field of<br>
    Information Technology, currently completing my bachelors degree at RMIT via Open Universities <br>
    Australia. I was born in Australia and raised with an Italian background (as you may be able to tell<br>
    from the surname) so I have a great appreciation for good food that was instilled into me from my Nonno.<br>
    <br>
    Back in high school, I had a vast interest in chemistry and IT, even going on to become a Victorian <br>
    finalist in a chemistry competition held by RACI (Royal Australian Chemistry Institute). My keen<br>
    interest in IT first appeared during this time and it led to me dabbling in ametuer programming in<br> 
    the form of .bat file programs, trying to write up programs that create hidden lockable folders that<br>
    can only be revealed with the right code. Once I left school, I pursued a bachelor's degree in science,<br>
    hoping to major in chemistry. However, due to personal circumstances, I had to forfeit my position in<br>
    the course and take up work. During my spare time though I started to play around with website design,<br>
    learning how to host a website and do basic HTML/CSS coding. Eventually my interest in IT brought me to<br>
    the point where I needed a better computer, so I learnt how to build one! After saving up as much money<br>
    as I could, spending countless hours looking at parts and working out compatibilities, I built my first<br>
    PC and got straight into using VMware to emulate a MacOS environment to learn how to create iPhone apps.<br>
    However sadly I found myself too busy and not motivated enough to continue, so I stopped my IT experiments<br>
    and now after many years of not following up on what I had taught myself, most of it has slipped away...<br>
    but that is why I am eager to learn all of the skills I can in this field to prepare myself for a rewarding<br>
    career in the IT industry.<br>
    <br>
	I chose to study at RMIT due to the availability and accessibility of the course, the reviews that my<br>
    friends who have graduated from RMIT gave to me about the University itself, and because I know that what<br>
    I will be learning there will be deeply valued by the ICT industry and is consistently updating according<br>
    to what is favourable and required in the industry.<br>
	During my studies, I am expecting to learn all of the necessary skills required to begin a long and prosperous<br>
    career in the IT field, such as learning about the fundamentals of software engineering, understanding how<br>
    complex networking systems work, and learning about system security.
