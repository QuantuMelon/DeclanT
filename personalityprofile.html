	</h2>
    
    <h3><div class="a">
    According to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test, I am an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality" target="_blank">ENFJ-T Protagonist</a> personality. People with<br>
	this personality type are typically strong leaders full of passion and charisma. They makeup 2% of the<br>
	general population (Introduction | Protagonist ENFJ 2020) and often take up roles in politics, teaching,<br>
	or coaching, as they are very influential people. They take great pride in leading and guiding others to<br>
	work together to make themselves and the world a better place. Protagonists can use their idealism and<br>
	vision to overcome challenges that they may face, often resulting in improving the lives of those around<br>
	them while they do this. However as helpful as they can be, often this can lead to them being taken advantage<br>
	of by other personality types looking to exploit their good nature. This does not deter them from being an <br>
	outstanding individual dedicated to inspiring and helping those around them.<br>

    <h2><div class="c"> Learning Styles Test </h2>
    <h3><div class="c">
	The results from a <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml" target="_blank">Learning Styles test</a> taken recently show that I am an auditory/visual learner,<br>
	gaining most of my knowledge by either hearing and listening to what is happening or reading and <br>
	seeing pictures. People that are auditory learners understand and remember the things that they hear,<br>
	and store information by the way it sounds. They have an easier time understanding instructions that<br>
	are spoken rather than written. Those that are visual learners understand and remember things by sight,<br>
	hence the name. They can picture what they are learning in their head and learn best by using primarily<br>
	visual learning methods such as flashcards. The third learning style which was my minor score is the<br>
	tactile method. Tactile learners gain knowledge and experience best through hands-on learning and<br>
	practice of skills. Their primary way of learning is by doing activities and experiencing what they<br>
	are learning. The scores I received in the test were split almost evenly between the three methods<br>
	tested for, being auditory (35%), visual (35%), and tactile (30%). This means that there is the<br>	
	possibility I am a mixture of all three learning styles as there is always a margin of error in tests<br>
	such as this and the results given could be due to rounding biases in the tests calculations.<br>

    <h2><div class="a">Big Five Personality Test
    </h2>
    <h3><div class="a">
	I chose to take a <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test" target="_blank">Big Five Personality test</a> as my third choice as it is regarded as the most accepted<br>
    and commonly used model of personality in the study of psychology. The specific one I chose to do uses<br>
    the Big-Five Factor Markers from the International Personality Item Pool developed by American Psychologist<br>
    Lew Goldberg in 1992. The results I gained from this test are split into five factor markers (as the name<br>
    of the test might suggest!) consisting of Extroversion which is a factor of how outgoing and social you<br>
    are, Emotional Stability which is a measure of your ability to remain stable and balanced, Agreeableness<br>
    which is a factor of how friendly and optimistic you may be, Conscientiousness which is how careful and<br>
    diligent you are, and Intellect/Imagination which is how open to new experiences you are. I achieved scores<br>
    in the 70th, 57th, 67th, 72nd, and 59th respectively, all towards the larger end of the spectrum as seen below.<br>

	<h2><div class="b">My thoughts?
	</h2>
	<h3><div class="b">
	Personally, none of these test results directly affect me as I already knew who I was as a person and the<br>
	best methods for me to learn something, and those things are unlikely to change because of an online test of<br>
	any variety. However that being said, the MBTI test seemed to be the most accurate as far as describing who<br>
	I am as a person. Having read through the information on strengths & weaknesses and work habits for the ENFJ, I<br>
	picked up some interesting tips and tricks that can apply to general life that would be helpful for me as a person.<br>
	<br>
	The results may slightly influence my team behaviour in terms of making sure I don't allow myself to become<br>
	too weighed down when helping people with any problems they have, as well as ensuring that my good nature is<br>
	not taken advantage of by someone looking to slack off and not put in the required work, forcing me to do<br>
	significantly more than what is my fair share of work, but apart from these two things my inherent team<br>
	behaviour will not change as I was already the same respectful, empathetic, and understanding person that I<br>
	am, and I know how to diplomatically deal with problems that may arise in a fair and just manner.<br>
	<br>
	Taking these results directly into consideration when forming a team, I would be sure to choose people<br>
	that have complementary personalities that mesh together well, as well as ensuring that I know what they<br>
	believe their strengths & weaknesses to be and what their test results suggest their strengths and weaknesses<br>
	are. If I do not have a hand in choosing the members of the team, I would find out the personalities of<br>
	everyone involved and try to understand their ways of thinking. With the knowledge of that, I would make<br>
	sure they are doing a task that plays on their strengths to create the most effective team possible.<br>
