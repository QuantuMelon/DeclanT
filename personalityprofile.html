    <h4>
According to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test, I am an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality">ENFJ-T Protagonist</a> personality. People with<br>
this personality type are typically strong leaders full of passion and charisma. They makeup 2% of the<br>
general population (Introduction | Protagonist ENFJ 2020) and often take up roles in politics, teaching,<br>
or coaching, as they are very influential people. They take great pride in leading and guiding others to<br>
work together to make themselves and the world a better place. Protagonists can use their idealism and<br>
vision to overcome challenges that they may face, often resulting in improving the lives of those around<br>
them while they do this. However as helpful as they can be, often this can lead to them being taken advantage<br>
of by other personality types looking to exploit their good nature. This does not deter them from being an <br>
outstanding individual dedicated to inspiring and helping those around them.<br>
